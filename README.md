# Overview

* This is my program 'Inventory System' which I created over the course of 2 weeks. The intention for this program is to be basic inventory system where you are able to perform basic functions to help make managing your inventory easier.

* There are six basic functions to this inventory system: viewing the inventory, adding a new item, deleting an item, updating an item's quantity, changing an item's name, and exiting the system. 

* Each item in the inventory that you add is an 'object' which allows for most of the functionality that you see. This works because Main() class inherits the Item() class to allow each item to be it's own object. An additonal functionality is that the system will automatically give you warnings after each action you perform. For example, if an item's quantity is 5 or less, it will display that it has a low inventory, and if it has 0 in stock, it will say that it is out of stock.

* This program uses variables, expressions, conditionals, loops, functions, classes, data structures, and inheritance.

# Video Demonstration

* This is a brief video that I recorded which shows how to use the program and what goes on behind the scenes in terms of the code and structure.

# Development Environment

* The tool that I used to develop the software was Visual Studio Code. This is my favorite Integraded Development Environment because it is a very lightweight program yet it still includes a lot of advanced functionality.
* The programming language that I used to complete this project is Python in version 3.7.8 64-bit. It is a very interesting and unique language which is based around object oriented programming and I enjoy using it very much.
* Github is the online repository I used to store this project.
